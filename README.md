# Folder To Text - Project Overview Generator

A lightweight and simple desktop utility built entirely in **Java** to analyze a given project folder and generate a clean, text-based overview report.

This tool is designed to help developers quickly understand the structure and composition of a codebase, making it ideal for project documentation, handovers, or getting a high-level summary at a glance. It focuses on creating a functional Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java's native libraries and efficiently traversing the file system to gather statistics.

## Features

* **Project Statistics:** Calculates and displays the total number of files and the total size of the folder.
* **File Type Analysis:** Groups files by their extension and shows a count for each type, sorted by frequency.
* **Technology Detection:** Performs a basic scan of file names and extensions to suggest the technologies used in the project (e.g., Java, Maven, Node.js, React).
* **Directory Tree View:** Generates a classic, easy-to-read tree structure of the folder and its subdirectories.
* **Simple GUI:** Uses **Java Swing** to provide a straightforward user interface for selecting the target folder.
* **Formatted Output:** Presents all the collected information in a single, well-formatted report that can be easily copied and shared.

## How to Get Started

There are two ways to get this application running.

### Option 1: Download the Release (Easiest Way) ðŸš€

If you just want to use the application, you can download the latest pre-compiled version.

1.  Go to the **[Releases page](https://github.com/your-username/Folder-To-Text/releases)**.
2.  Download the latest `FolderToText.jar` file from the assets.
3.  Make sure you have at least Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.
4.  Open your terminal, navigate to the download directory, and run the application with the following command:
    ```bash
    java -jar FolderToText.jar
    ```

### Option 2: Build from Source (For Developers) ðŸ’»

If you want to modify the code or build it yourself, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Folder-To-Text.git](https://github.com/your-username/Folder-To-Text.git)
    cd Folder-To-Text
    ```
3.  **Compile the code:**
    ```bash
    javac FolderToText.java
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    java FolderToText
    ```

After running the application using either method, a file chooser dialog will appear. Select the project folder you want to analyze, and the report will be displayed in a new window.

## Project Status and Future Roadmap

**Current Status:** The project is fully functional and stable in its `v1.0` release. All the core features listed above are implemented and working.

- [Download v1.0 Pre-Alpha](https://github.com/SametCirik/FolderToText/releases/tag/v1.0)

**Future Plans (Roadmap):**

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Add support for running the analyzer from the terminal without a GUI, allowing for automation and scripting.
-  **Configuration File:** Implement a `.FTTignore` file (similar to `.gitignore`) to exclude specific files or directories (like `node_modules/` or `.git/`) from the analysis.
- **Multiple Output Formats:** Add options to export the report in different formats, such as **Markdown** or **JSON**.
- **"Copy to Clipboard" Button:** A simple UI enhancement to copy the entire report with a single click.
- **Advanced Technology Detection:** Improve the logic for detecting frameworks and libraries more accurately.

## Development Environment and Technologies

* **Language:** **Java**
* **Core Libraries:**
    * **Java Swing/AWT:** For the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
    * **Java NIO (`java.nio.file`):** For modern and efficient file system traversal.
* **IDE:** Developed in **Eclipse IDE** but can be compiled and run with any standard Java environment.
